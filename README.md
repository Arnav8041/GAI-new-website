# AI Club Website

Welcome to the official repository for the **AI Club Website**!  
This project is a work-in-progress web platform for our AI Club, designed to showcase our activities, connect members, and promote AI learning and events.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The AI Club Website is built with **HTML** and **CSS** (JavaScript coming soon!) and features a clean, modern theme.  
The site currently includes:

- **Home** (`index.html`)
- **About** (`about.html`)
- **Events** (`events.html`)
- **Contact** (`contact.html`)

The design and structure were initially scaffolded with AI assistance (Lovable), and are being customized to match our club’s branding and needs.
